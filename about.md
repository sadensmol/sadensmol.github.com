I work in my home office. It's quiet, very comfortable and has all needed things for productive work.

My working hours are flexible. Usually I get up at 7 AM and start working on the hardest project ( an hour in the morning is worth two in the evening! ).
I can work also by nights. My timezone is MSK ( GMT + 4 ) so for some US clients I have to work by nights.
But it's okay because I really love my work!

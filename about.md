I'm Denis Sazonov, software developer from Smolensk/Russia. 
I work fulltime as freelance programmer on [Odesk.com](http://www.odesk.com/)
and [Elance.com](http://www.elance.com/)

I really like game programming. This is what Im living for :).
I started programming when I was 12 yo. I love minecraft, doom 1,2 and sims 3.

### I know and have experience in programming with the following list of languages:

* Java ( J2EE, J2SE )
* ActionScipt3 (Air, Air for mobiles), Flex
* Objective-C
* SQL, PL/SQL

### Frameworks, IDEs and technologies I can use in my work:

* Spring, Hibernate,NoSQL ( membase, mongo )
* Starling, BlazeDS
* CoreData, UIKit, Cocos2d, cocos2d-x
* Box2d
* Tomcat, JBoss, Red5, Wowza, SmartFox
* Eclipse, Flash Builder, XCode
* SVN,Git,Mercurial


I've all needed equipment to test applications on Windows, Linux, Mac platforms as well as on Android or iPad devices.

I work in my home office. It's quiet, very comfortable and has all needed things for productive work.

My working hours are flexible. Usually I get up at 7 AM and start working on the hardest project ( an hour in the morning is worth two in the evening! ).
I can work also by nights. My timezone is MSK ( GMT + 4 ) so for some US clients I have to work by nights.
But it's okay because I really love my work!

## About choosing projects on Odesk

	I think many freelancers are thinking on how to find, how to choose proper project/client on Odesk. Most of them are working hard, others are using Odesk for side work.

	Im looking for new projects on daily basis, looking for some interesing projects/problems to work on. In my daily scedule I have 3 parts of work runs - morning when I can solve most diffucult problems ( when I work with fresh mind ), afternoon, when I work on usual, sometimes annoying things for current projects and evening spring, when I can work just for fun, with some new technologies, new interesting projects or just use this time to learn something new ( out of Odesk ).
    It's good to have 2 hourly based project ( one of them in active development stage and other one in support ), so in this case you don't need to care about money - you can just relax and work within client's plan, providing good, up-to-date solutions or help client to use your already developed project. And you know sometimes it's very hard to find some good hourly based project on Odesk! But I'm happy that I have ones, and when Im looking for next one it's easy to find for me - I've not much rate and quite good feedback from old project. Actually Im always providing my best for every project, I think its the main rule to work on Odesk - JUST DO YOUR BEST!
    Every evening I can work on some hourly based project, and I don't care much about clients from those projects - for me its just some ability to learn something new, or try new technologies I dont know much - so it's just some kind of work for future, selecting some new ways to go on next project. Hourly based projects havent garanteed payments, but I can go with this risks, because I can learn much and it costs too for me! But Im really happy also when client sends me a payment after project done.

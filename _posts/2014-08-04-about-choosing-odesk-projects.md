## About choosing projects on Odesk

	I think many freelancers are thinking on how to find, how to choose proper project/client on Odesk. Most of them are working hard, others are using Odesk for side work.

	Im looking for new projects on daily basis, looking for some interesing projects/problems to work on. In my daily scedule I have 3 parts of work runs - morning when I can solve most diffucult problems ( when I work with fresh mind ), afternoon, when I work on usual, sometimes annoying things for current projects and evening spring, when I can work just for fun, with some new technologies, new interesting projects or just use this time to learn something new ( out of Odesk ).
    It's good to have 2 hourly based project ( one of them in active development stage and other one in support ), so in this case you don't need to care about money - you can just relax and work within client's plan, providing good, up-to-date solutions or help client to use your already developer project.

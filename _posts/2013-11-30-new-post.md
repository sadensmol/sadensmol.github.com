Recently I've found very good article about blogging on GitHub. And now I'm here, my first blog is ready and I'm gonna place all information about it here.

## About Jekyll

So, what's Jekyll and how to create a blog on GitHub.
Jekyll is static pages generator. It supports different template and CSS engines ( Liquid, Bootstrap ) etc. It uses on GitHub to deploy and showing user pages.

Please check out the following links:

* [Jekyll home site](http://jekyllrb.com)
* [Jekyll bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com)

Of course you can use Twitter bootstrap with Jekyll.


First time i started understanding Jekyll i didn't realize that there're already tons of pages and blogs all over the globe working under Jekyll. Just take a look at this [list of sites using Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Sites).
It's so amazing!

*So, if you're programmer or tech geek it's time to move from Blogger or  WP to Jekyll and GitHub!*


Here is the [Minimal Mistakes Theme](http://http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)  I've used for this blog ( It includes demo, samples and source codes ).

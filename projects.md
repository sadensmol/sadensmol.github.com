It's content curation software which allows users to find content over the internet by using different search sources ( youtube, google, amazon, instagram, twitter etc ) and then compose posts in inbuilt post builder and publish it to any of supported blog platforms. Our customers really love this software.

I work alone as client side programmer added all functionality application has at the moment.

Used technologies: Adobe Air/Flex, PHP, JS, Facebook api, wordless api, blogger api, google search api, twitter api, instagram api …

Now client is going to create mobile applications based on desktop app code ( on Adobe Air tech ). Im working as support member now, answering support tickets, do some upgrades and fixes.

- Christian Filipina

It’s the best dating site/application I’ve ever seen. Too many girls from Philippines are looking for their men.
They all are Christian.

I created web version of Video Chat ( based on WOWZA media server ), implemented iOS and android applications with full site functionality. So people can use website, mobile or desktop applications to meet with each other!
I work alone as client side programmer, manage design team and server team to help in implementation.I manage android and iTunes accounts for mobile apps and also web side of desktop app ( upgrade functionality ).

Used technologies: Adobe Air/Flex,as3, java, different ANE extensions, Facebook api, json/xml server side api, in app purchases.

Working hard at the moment on new features, new functionality. We improve application every day.

It’s simple 3 screens question-answer android game based on Cocos2d-x framework.

I did port for this project from IOS platform to Android. Projects used Parse framework for storing game data/stats, so it took about 1 week with 2 hrs/day work to port 3000 lines of code from objective-c to java. I did also some changes in cocos2d-x code and upgraded this framework to new version.

Used technologies: Objective-C, c++,cocos2d-x, parse, facebook api

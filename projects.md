**2013-now**

Projects Im working on for the last year:

- CurationSoft
([http://curationsoft.com/](http://curationsoft.com/ "CurationSoft") )

![CurationSoft]({{ site.url }}/images/projects_cs_screenshot.png)


It's content curation software which allows users to find content over the internet by using different search sources ( youtube, google, amazon, instagram, twitter etc ) and then compose posts in inbuilt post builder and publish it to any of supported blog platforms. Our customers really love this software.

I work alone as client side programmer added all functionality application has at the moment.
Used technologies: Adobe Air/Flex, PHP, JS.
Now client is going to create mobile applications based on desktop app code ( on Adobe Air tech ).

- Christian Filipina
([https://www.christianfilipina.com/](https://www.christianfilipina.com/ "Christian Filipina") )

![ChristianFilipina]({{ site.url }}/images/projects_cf_image.jpg)

It’s the best dating site/application I’ve ever seen. Too many girls from Philippines are looking for their men.
They all are Christian.

I created web version of Video Chat ( based on WOWZA media server ), implemented iOS and android applications with full site functionality. So people can use website, mobile or desktop applications to meet with each other!
I work alone as client side programmer, manage design team and server team to help in implementation.

Used technologies: Adobe Air/Flex,as3, java, different ANE extensions.
